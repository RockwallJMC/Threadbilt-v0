# Component Docs Map

Use these docs in `src/docs/component-docs/` as the source of truth for layout primitives:

- `BoxDoc.jsx` – theme-aware container, `sx` usage
- `ContainerDoc.jsx` – page width constraints (fluid/fixed)
- `GridDoc.jsx` – MUI v7 grid with `size` prop and spacing patterns
- `StackDoc.jsx` – vertical rhythm and responsive direction
- `PaperDoc.jsx` – card surfaces and background levels
